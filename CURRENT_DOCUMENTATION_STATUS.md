## ðŸ“ˆ **DOCUMENTATION QUALITY METRICS**

### **Before Cleanup**
- **Total Files:** 32
- **Current Files:** ~16 (50%)
- **Outdated Files:** ~16 (50%)
- **Navigation:** Difficult due to clutter

### **After Cleanup**
- **Root Files:** 16 (all current or updateable)
- **Archive Files:** 20 (historical reference)
- **Navigation:** Clean and organized
- **Maintenance:** Much easier to keep current

## ðŸŽ¯ **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Update Priority Files** - Focus on system evaluation and integration reports
2. **Maintain Current Files** - Keep core documentation up to date
3. **Regular Reviews** - Monthly review of documentation currency
4. **Archive Management** - Keep archive organized for historical reference

This cleanup significantly improves the project's documentation organization and makes it much easier to maintain current, relevant documentation.
